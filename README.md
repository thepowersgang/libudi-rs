Very experimental bindings to allow writing UDI (Universal Driver Interface) drivers in rust

Uses an absolute pile of hacks to make the callback-based async of UDI work with rust's poll-based async

DO NOT USE THIS. It's mostly a fun experiment to see if the concept can work and be anywhere near efficient.
